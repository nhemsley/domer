CSG plugin for Three.js

Based almost entirely on [chandlerprall/ThreeCSG](https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG) :heart:
but ported to [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and cleaned up a little.

### Quickstart and Demo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sshirokov/ThreeBSP.git
$ npm install .
$ python -mSimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:8000 and you should see something
like this
